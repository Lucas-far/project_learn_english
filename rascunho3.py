You love me
What would you say
What can you do
I Feel so Strong
I Feel Brand New
And I can give my all to you
I wanna feel emotion
I wanna wrap you in my arms
And never leave you lonely
Forever stay here by your side
You Show Me
You Love Me
You Show Me
You Love Me
You Show Me Love
You Show me how to breakaway
Living in a brand new day
You Show Me Love
You Show me how to breakaway
Living in a brand new day
You wake me up
You change me
You keep on lighting the way
You show me love
You show me how to break away
Living in a brand new day
Living in a brand new day
What would you say
What can you do
I Feel so Strong
I Feel Brand New
And I can give my all to you
I wanna feel emotion
I wanna wrap you in my arms
And never leave you lonely
Forever stay here by your side
You Show Me
